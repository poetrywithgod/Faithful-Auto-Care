/*
  # Add Anonymous Admin Policies for Development

  1. Policy Updates
    - Add policies allowing anon role to perform admin operations
    - This is for development purposes only
    - In production, these should be restricted to authenticated admin users

  2. Security Notes
    - These policies allow unauthenticated access
    - Should be replaced with proper authentication before production deployment
